## Yolo2 on Caffe

This yolo2 branch is a port of yolo2 darknet to Caffe, the code is modified from these following repositories:
- https://github.com/gklz1982/caffe-yolov2
- https://github.com/zhangnju/caffe/tree/yolo

Network prototxt and scripts for training/inference is at examples/yolo2.
- examples/yolo2/yolo_detection.cpp could be used to test a picture.
- examples/yolo2/data/convert.sh generates lmdb for training. Images are letterboxed as in yolo2 provided weights are trained on, the script converting yolo2 weights to caffemodel is also provided.
- To do training please note the file path in script and prototxt. Tested on VOC dataset.

## Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by Berkeley AI Research ([BAIR](http://bair.berkeley.edu))/The Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors.
